We are creating an AI training web application for the company internal use among empoyees.
General:
1. We work on Windows 11 and use PoswerShell command syntax
2. Ask before file deletion
3. Avoid inline comments, but use method and class documenting
4. Combine commands using ';' like command1 -args; command2 -args

For angular:
1. We use standalone components
2. If any provided examples contain different style frameworks rewrite it to SCSS
3. Use Angular Material for UI components
4. After EACH editing set try to build the application and fix errors if any show up. Finish only after you ensure the build is clean without errors
5. Use iOS styles  guidelines with glass effect
6. Use Angular CLI where possible
7. If you somehow run the app and see that port 4200 is busy stop attemting to run the app. It means app is already running by user.
8. Main colors except grayscale are gradient 3BFFCB and 7F38FF 

For .NET / C#:
1. Use .NET 9
2. Use latest c# features
3. Avoid using non Microsoft libraries without asking
4. Use minimal APIs
5. Use top level statements
6. After editing try to build the application and fix errors if any show up
7. Use Result pattern where possible
8. We use FluentValidation for validation
9. We use Entity Framework Core for data access
